# NetPractice

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by <rbaaloua>.*

## Description  
NetPractice is a hands-on networking simulation project designed to introduce fundamental networking concepts. The goal is to configure small-scale TCP/IP networks by assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to ensure proper communication between devices. Through 10 interactive levels, you will learn how to troubleshoot and configure networks involving routers, switches, and hosts in a virtual environment.

## Instructions  
- Download the provided `NetPractice` archive from the project page and extract it.  
- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to launch the training interface.  
- Enter your intranet login when prompted to personalize the exercise.  
- For each level, adjust the unshaded fields (IP, mask, gateway, routes) to meet the connectivity goals.  
- Use the **Check again** button to verify your configuration.  
- Once a level is solved, use the **Get my config** button to export your configuration as a file.  
- Place all 10 exported configuration files (e.g., `level1.json`, `level2.json`, …) at the root of your Git repository.  
- During evaluation, you will be required to solve 3 randomly selected levels within a limited time, without external tools (except basic calculators like `bc`).

### AI Usage in This Project  
AI was used to:  
- **Explain networking concepts** – to clarify topics such as subnet calculation, routing logic, and the role of default gateways when solving levels.  
- **Afford learning resources** – to identify and recommend relevant external documentation, tutorials, and practice tools for deepening networking knowledge.  
- **Help organize the README.md file** – to structure the content, ensure all required sections were included, and improve overall readability and compliance with project guidelines.
